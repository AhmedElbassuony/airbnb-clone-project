## 🔒 API Security

Security is fundamental to protect users, transactions, and the platform.

### **1. Authentication**
Implemented via **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure session handling.  
Prevents unauthorized access and protects personal information.

### **2. Authorization**
Role-based permissions restrict access based on user type.  
Ensures that only authorized users can manage sensitive data.

### **3. Data Encryption**
All sensitive data is encrypted **in transit** (HTTPS/SSL) and **at rest**.  
Protects private information like passwords and payments.

### **4. Rate Limiting**
Limits API requests to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.  
Ensures fair usage and protects server stability.

### **5. Input Validation**
Sanitizes and validates all inputs to prevent **SQL Injection** and **XSS**.  
Maintains data integrity and system reliability.

### **6. Secure Payment Handling**
Integrates with **PCI DSS-compliant** gateways to ensure financial safety.  
Prevents fraud and protects users’ financial data.

### **7. Logging & Monitoring**
Tracks API activity, failed logins, and unauthorized access attempts.  
Helps detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

### **Why Security Matters**
- 🛡️ Protects sensitive user data  
- 💳 Secures payment information  
- 🤝 Builds trust and compliance  
- 🧠 Prevents misuse and attacks

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### **Overview**
The **CI/CD pipeline** automates testing, building, and deployment, ensuring smooth and reliable delivery.  
It helps maintain high code quality, faster iterations, and consistent releases.

### **Why CI/CD Is Important**
- **Automation:** Eliminates manual build and deployment errors.  
- **Faster Feedback:** Detects bugs early through automated testing.  
- **Consistency:** Delivers identical environments using containerization.  
- **Continuous Delivery:** Enables regular, safe updates without downtime.  
- **Collaboration:** Improves workflow integration between developers and DevOps teams.

### **Tools Used**
- **GitHub Actions** → Automates build, test, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker** → Containers for isolated, reproducible environments.  
- **Docker Compose** → Manages multi-container applications for integration testing.  
- **Jenkins / GitLab CI / CircleCI** → Alternative CI/CD tools for advanced pipelines.

### **Example Workflow**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.  
2. GitHub Actions triggers the CI/CD workflow.  
3. Code is built and tested in Docker containers.  
4. If tests pass, deployment occurs automatically.  
5. Monitoring ensures system stability post-deployment.
